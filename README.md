# 🎨 Sprite Editor

A simple Qt6-based sprite editing tool built for CS3505 with some classmates. I
then decided to package it using **Nix Flakes** since I wanted some practice
with nix packaging.

## ✨ Features

- 🖌️ Pixel-by-pixel editing
- 💻 Gif Exporting
- 🖼️ Multiple layer support
- 📦 Qt Designer–based UI
- 🔧 Reproducible builds via Nix Flakes

## 🚀 Running with Nix

If you have **Nix with flakes enabled**, you can run the app immediately:

### **Run directly from GitHub**

```bash
nix run github:Sinjin2300/Sprite-Editor
```
